## About Netl

Netl is an open-source project in its early stages, with a vision to simplify how data pipelines are built and managed. The core idea is to provide an intuitive, visual node-based interface for creating ETL workflows, while leveraging the speed and efficiency of [Polars](https://www.pola.rs/) under the hood.

We want Netl to be:

- **Self-hostable:** Easily deployable on Docker or Kubernetes, giving you full control over your data environment without relying on external cloud services.
- **User-friendly yet extensible:** A clean drag-and-drop interface thatâ€™s approachable for analysts, but flexible enough for developers to extend with custom nodes and integrations.
- **Built-in testing:** Designed with testing capabilities from the start, so you can verify your pipelines and reduce the risk of errors in production.

## Why Netl?

Many ETL tools today either overwhelm users with complexity or lack the power needed for production workloads. Netl aims to strike a balance by combining modern, performant technologies with a straightforward user experience.

Polars offers blazing-fast data processing, and Netl will provide the tools to build, visualize, and orchestrate pipelines that scale, whether for prototyping or production use.
